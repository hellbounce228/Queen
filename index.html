                    Though Freddie Mercury's passing in 1991 marked the end of an era, Queen continues to thrive today with "Queen + Adam Lambert." In 2011, the band's original members, Brian May (guitar) and Roger Taylor (drums), partnered with Adam Lambert, a talented vocalist who gained recognition from American Idol. While Mercury's presence is irreplaceable, Lambert has been praised for capturing the energy and theatricality that Freddie brought to the stage, while still making the performances his own.
